## Want to standardize all your new Java projects?
This is a decreasingly simple bash utility for creating new Java projects from the command line interface. This started from my wanting to figure automate making a couple of directories and then snowballed from there. 
This is a learning project, and through it I've learned a good amount of shell scripting and a lot of good practices for structuring projects (Java in specific, but some lessons apply more broadly)

## Key Features
- Options for creating projects of different scopes
- Automatically creates a local git repo and adds basic to gitignore

## Future plans
Not many at the moment. A bit more validation and general tidy up.
I had originally set out to practice my Java, and somehow ended up making this, learning vim, installing all kinds of new tools, and generally not doing anything in Java.
